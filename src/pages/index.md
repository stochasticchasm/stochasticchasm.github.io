Hello, and welcome to my blog. I hope you enjoy your stay.

I post about machine learning, mainly transformers/LLMs. I'd say my main interests within that domain are multimodality, creativity, and interpretability â€” though these may change as I learn more and more cool things happen in the world. I'm also interested in human-computer interaction.

I currently work as a backend software engineer. My interests here are mainly distributed systems. I plan to keep this website ML-related, however.

If you want to contact me, [Twitter/X](https://x.com/stochasticchasm) is probably the best way to do so.
